  <div class="about-game">
    <p>The Number Guessing Game is an interactive computational exercise in probabilistic reasoning,
      designed to engage users in iterative hypothesis testing within a predefined numerical range. The objective is to
      accurately determine a randomly generated integer within the inclusive bounds of 1 to 100, constrained by a
      maximum
      of 10 attempts. The system provides immediate feedback on the relative positioning of each guess in relation to
      the
      target value, thereby enabling the player to refine subsequent predictions. The game concludes either upon
      successful identification of the number or upon exhaustion of the allotted attempts, at which point a reset
      mechanism facilitates replayability.
