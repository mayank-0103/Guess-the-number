# Number Guessing Game

## Overview
The Number Guessing Game is an interactive computational exercise in probabilistic reasoning, designed to engage users in iterative hypothesis testing within a predefined numerical range. The objective is to accurately determine a randomly generated integer within the inclusive bounds of 1 to 100, constrained by a maximum of 10 attempts. The system provides immediate feedback on the relative positioning of each guess in relation to the target value, thereby enabling the player to refine subsequent predictions. The game concludes either upon successful identification of the number or upon exhaustion of the allotted attempts, at which point a reset mechanism facilitates replayability.

## Features
- 🎲 Stochastic number generation within a bounded integer space (1–100).
- 🔍 Real-time computational feedback for hypothesis refinement.
- 📋 Historical tracking of prior inputs for strategic assessment.
- 🔄 Automated game-state reset upon completion of a session.
- 🎨 Intuitive user interface incorporating dynamic visual elements.

## Files Included
- 📄 `index.html` - Core structural framework utilizing semantic HTML.
- 🎨 `style.css` - Cascading Style Sheets for aesthetic and responsive enhancements.
- 📜 `script.js` - JavaScript implementation governing game logic and event handling.
- 📜 `LICENSE` - Legal documentation outlining usage rights and restrictions.

## How to Play
1. 🖥️ Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.
2. 🔢 Input a numeric value within the permissible range (1–100).
3. 🎯 Engage the "SUBMIT GUESS" mechanism to initiate evaluation.
4. 📊 Receive immediate comparative analysis of the entered value.
5. ⏳ Continue iterative guessing until either success or termination conditions are met.
6. 🔄 Utilize the "Start new game" function to reset computational parameters for subsequent gameplay.
